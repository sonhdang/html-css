        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Singing is my way of expressing my feelings, usually through other people's words; because the songs I sing aren't mine. They were written by someone else and the songs are how the song writers describe their feelings. I do wish someday I can express my feelings in my own words though. Whenever I discover a catchy song or well written/produced song, I get so hyped up about writing and producing my own song. The hype usually dies off after a few days but during those few days, I would get so hopeful that I will learn to write and produce. If only I have the skills and knowledge to do so, even if my songs aren't good, I'd still be so incredibly satisfied.</p>

        <p>No goal, no motivation, no energy left to do anything. That is how I have been feeling for the past week after finishing all of my final exams for Spring 2021. It is not that because I have nothing left to do or no goal to work towards. I do keep track of all the things I need to do but right now, they are nothing more than descriptions of a responsible adult. It's funny how I felt so frustrated while I was busy studying and didn't have time to do all the things on the list but now that I do have time to do them, I just don't feel like doing anymore. Is this what burned out feels like?</p>
