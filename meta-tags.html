        <!-- We place meta tags within our <head> tag
            Meta data has some usage for search engine and web browser and a few other benefits
            Meta data lets these entities and your web browser know what your webpage is about and what kind of content it contains
            There's other usages of meta tags that allow us to control the viewport, which is the visible area of a webpage when you switch devices such as if you're viewing on a mobile device or a tablet
            Meta tags will give the browser instructions on the dimension of your page once it's displayed it on a mobile device or if it's displayed on a laptop or a desktop
            We use the tag 'meta' tag and it's a self-closing tag so we don't need a closing tag-->
